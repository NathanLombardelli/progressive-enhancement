<h4>The story</h4>

<blockquote>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <span class="villagers">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</span> The farmer said, <strong class="farmer">“Maybe.”</strong> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <span class="villagers">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</span> The farmer again said, <strong class="farmer">“Maybe.”</strong>

    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <span class="villagers">“Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad"> bad</span>,”</span> and the farmer responded, <strong class="farmer">“Maybe.”</strong> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <span class="villagers">“Isn’t that great!”</span> Again, he said, <strong class="farmer">“Maybe.”</strong>

    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good"> good </span> or <span class="bad"> bad </span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good"> good </span> fortune.

<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p><span class="good"> Good </span> and <span class="bad"> Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span>  for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good </span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
